 [![My GitHub Stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=formerlybased)](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats)

 Hello! I am formerlybased (also known as IAMACAR). I'm a programmer with an interest in graphics, games & game engines, and networks. 
 My most commonly used languages are C++ and Rust.

 The first game engine I made [game engine](https://github.com/feather-game-engine/feather), although that's kind of abandoned (and not particularly good)
 Currently working on some other projects (including a new graphics project with Rust & Vulkan)
